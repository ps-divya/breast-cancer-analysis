# 🎗️ Breast Cancer Analysis using Power BI

## 📌 Overview
This project delivers a data-driven analysis of breast cancer using the METABRIC dataset in Power BI. It explores patient demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment patterns, and survival trends to uncover key factors influencing outcomes. By combining clinical data with interactive dashboards, the report provides insights that support oncological research, patient care decisions, and strategic healthcare planning.

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 🧍‍♀️Patient Demographics
- Patients aged 41–60 have the highest survival rate.
- The 80+ age group shows a significantly higher mortality rate compared to younger groups.

### 📉 Survival Trends
- 45.6% of patients are deceased, while 33.36% are living — indicating a high mortality rate.
- Survival and relapse-free months steadily decrease from Stage 2 to Stage 4.

### 💊 Treatment Effectiveness
- Multimodal treatments (surgery, hormone therapy, radiotherapy) lead to improved survival outcomes.

### 🔬 Tumor Characteristics
- Larger tumors are associated with shorter survival durations.
- Invasive breast carcinoma shows the lowest survival rate among subtypes.
- Early-stage diagnoses result in significantly higher survival rates.

## ✅ Recommendations

- **Promote early detection** through public awareness and wider access to screenings and diagnostics.  
- **Adopt personalized treatments** based on tumor biology, mutation patterns, and disease stage.  
- **Invest in genomic research**, especially for HER2-enriched and triple-negative breast cancer.  
- **Leverage data-driven tools** like predictive models and dashboards to guide clinical decisions and improve outcomes.
